Miracles For Paws Rescue Inc. is a nonprofit, no-kill rescue dedicated to providing a second chance to dogs in need. 
We believe that every dog deserves a loving home, regardless of their past circumstances. Whether they have been abandoned, 
surrendered, or left homeless due to unforeseen circumstances, we are committed to ensuring they receive the care, love, 
and stability they deserve.

Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and re-home dogs, primarily from Puerto Rico, where many stray and abandoned animals 
struggle to survive. Through our efforts, we provide them with proper medical care, nourishment, and socialization, 
preparing them for a fresh start with families who will cherish them.

We strive to match each dog with the perfect forever home, where they can experience unconditional love and a safe, happy life. 
At Miracles For Paws Rescue Inc., we believe in second chancesâ€”not just for the dogs we save, but for the families who open their 
hearts to them. Together, we can make a difference, one rescue at a time.
